    <p>Welcome to our travel adventure! I'm a huge travel enthusiast, which I am sure is shared by many of you, having explored 23 countries and 29 territories so far, with plenty more on my bucket list.
    </p>
    <p>For this feature, I had a blast chatting with four awesome women between 21 to 25 years old who've bravely taken on solo travel around the globe. They shared their insights on their favorite trips around the world.
    </p>
    <p>So, let's dive into their stories and the amazing places they've visited!</p>

    <h2>📍1st stop - Seychelles</h2>

<p>Seychelles 🇸🇨 is the smallest country in Africa!</p>
<p> Hannah Neves, 23, has traveled to 21 countries and chose Seychelles as her favorite destination.

<p> “I really loved it because it was very sunny, the weather was warm, there were a lot of beaches,” she said. “The people were very nice and welcoming.”
</p>
<p>Seychelles, an island country and archipelagic state with 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, boasts numerous beaches, diverse fauna, and flora, making it a nature enthusiast's paradise.
</p>
<p>Hannah visited Seychelles to participate in marine conservation efforts near the capital, Victoria. She went scuba diving multiple times a day, documenting coral loss and invertebrate populations in the ocean's national park areas.

<p>“I made lots of amazing friends and got to talk to a lot of conservation officials and specialists in the area,” she said. “They all do good work.”
        </p>
<p>Overall, Seychelles is considered a safe destination, especially for travelers without a car.
        </p>
<p>“I was actually very surprised at how effective and easy to understand the public transport system was,” she said. “I was able to go to very far away places using buses which was very cheap. That was really fun.”

<p>With a history spanning millennia, Egypt 🇪🇬is known as a cradle of civilization, dating back to the 6th–4th millennia BCE. 
</p>
<p>Lorena Ribeiro, 24, has traveled to 47 countries, starting her explorations during college and continuing ever since. Among all her travels, Egypt stands out as the most surprising destination.</p>
<p>“I always thought of Egypt as primarily a historical destination, always thinking that if I toured for more than a week I would just start to get bored by seeing the same type of architecture over and over and over again,” she said. “When visiting Egypt, I was actually mindblown by the diversity of fantastic activities available.”

        <p>“Asking why I keep traveling is the same as asking why I go to my yearly doctor’s visit,” Lorena said. “I mean, as long as I can afford to go, I will go, because I recognize how much it benefits my health.”</p>

  <p>Yasmin Almeida, 21, the youngest among those interviewed, shared her surprise and enthusiasm for Egypt, naming it her favorite travel destination. She ventured to Egypt with AIESEC, an international youth-led non-profit organization providing business development internships worldwide to young people. During her program, she actively promoted tourism in Egypt by exploring cities and showcasing the places they visited.
  </p>
  <p>“My favorite country that I have been to so far has definitely been Egypt because of the people and the culture. It is a place that I have a lot of good memories,” she said. “I got to meet so many people from different parts of the world and they have become my friends and ever since I can not let go of them. We have been friends since 2022 when I went to Egypt.”

  <p>Yasmin, currently studying international relations in Brazil, sought a cultural experience in a foreign country.</p>
  <p>“It is such a beautiful and historical place. You can learn a lot,” she said. “It is very different from how things work here in America, and in South America specifically. This is why it is currently my favorite country.”
